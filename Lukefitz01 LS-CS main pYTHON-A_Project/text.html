    <h2>Investigation</h2>
    <p>The first system I investigated was Fitbit. One feature of Fitbit is tracking step count by using an accelerometer and transferring the analogue movement data to digital data. I liked the way the Fitbit transfers this data from analogue to digital and investigated using a step-counting system in my project, but I rejected it as I found the plausibility of having to carry around the microbit limited. (McLaughlin, 2021)   </p>
    <p>The second system I investigated was the walk in my shoes website. The website uses mindfulness exercise and wellness activities to help people relax. I liked the proven effectiveness of mindfulness exercises in use here, but rejected this system due to the difficulty of making auditory recordings for my project (Wellbeing activities for Young People)   </p>
    <p>The final system I investigated is Reaction Time & Reflex Test app. The apps main feature is a game that tracks your reaction time and logs your progression. I chose this system as I believe I can help improve productivity and concentration by using reaction time.  (Thinkabout, 2020) </p>
    <p>My system works by user pressing a button on the website to start the game. The lights on the microbit will then light up before turning off at the same time, after a random time. The user will press the button again quickly after the lights turn off to log reaction time and the area temperature. This data will be compared to externally sourced data to predict/inform decisions on Sport and Productivity. My target audience is people looking to pick up sports, along with people who long manual labour jobs.  </p>
    <p>My research enabled me to identify the key factors to implement and abstract by looking the features of each system I investigated and comparing to the project brief. I will abstract the CSS styling, creating an account function, other games on my final system along with the “Contact us" and "Privacy Policy” pages. </p>
    <p>My objectives are to model a system which:  
        <ul class="textlist">
            <li>Is fully automated, uses the analogue temperature input, the reaction time input, the analogue audio output and the digital LED output </li>
            <li>Validates and stores the data gathered from the microbit in firebase </li>
            <li>Analyses the data gathered to inform decisions on what sport the user should take up. Data will also be analysed to inform the decision on whether a manual worker needs a break to increase productivity. </li>
            <li>Uses Python and/or JavaScript to create a graph of reaction times which effects the what if questions. </li>
            <li>Offers wellbeing insights based on these two “what if” questions: </li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;What if the user was to take up a sport? Parameters: Age,Gender,Reaction time </li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;What if the user was to take a break from their manual labour? Parameters: Reaction time, Time Working , Temperature </li>
            <li>Graphs the history of the user's reaction time  </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Plan and design</h2>
    <p>Users start the system by clicking a button on the website. The microbit's lights turn on one by one. They then go off together after a random time. Users then quickly press the button again after the lights go off to record their reaction time and the current temperature of the area. After analyzing this data, along with externally sourced data, the two “what if” questions will be answered, and the information will be displayed to user on the website </p>
    <p>This system meets the requirements of the brief as it Is automated has an analogue temperature input, digital mouse input, analogue audio output and digital LED output. The system also validates and stores this input data in firebase </p>
    <p>The system will analyse the input data to make decisions on what sport the user should take up. This will also inform a decision on if a manual worker should take a break to increase their productivity. </p>
    <p>The system will use Python and JavaScript to make a graph of the user's reaction times which will be a data input for the “what if” questions. </p>
    <p>These “what if” questions will be: “What if the user was to take up a sport?” with the parameters of Age, Gender and Reaction time. The second what if question will be: “What if the user was to take a break from their manual labour?” with the parameters of Reaction time, Age and Temperature </p>
    <p>For the technologies I will use, I will use the microbit. The microbit is a hardware ARM-based embedded system. It will be used in showing the 5 lights for the reaction time game ,audio output and temperature input.  </p>
    <p>Other technologies I will use include:</p>
    <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It will be used in coding up data transfer to and from firebase. </p>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language and the core technology of the World Wide Web. I will use it in coding related to the website and data transfer </p>
    <p>HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It will be used to code by the website </p>
   <p>Visual studio code is an IDE. It will be used for coding HTML , CSS and JavaScript. </p>
   <p>Thonny is an IDE. It will be used for coding python. </p>
   <p>Google Firebase is a backend cloud computing service and application development platform. It will be used to store the input data and other data required for the project. </p>
