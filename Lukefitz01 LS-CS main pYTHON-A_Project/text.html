        <h2>Investigation</h2>
        <p>The first system I investigated was Fitbit. One feature of Fitbit is tracking step count by using an
            accelerometer and transferring the analogue movement data to digital data. I liked the way the Fitbit
            transfers this data from analogue to digital and investigated using a step-counting system in my project,
            but I rejected it as I found the plausibility of having to carry around the microbit limited. (McLaughlin,
            2021) </p>
        <p>The second system I investigated was the walk in my shoes website. The website uses mindfulness exercise and
            wellness activities to help people relax. I liked the proven effectiveness of mindfulness exercises in use
            here, but rejected this system due to the difficulty of making auditory recordings for my project (Wellbeing
            activities for Young People) </p>
        <p>The final system I investigated is Reaction Time & Reflex Test app. The apps main feature is a game that
            tracks your reaction time and logs your progression. I chose this system as I believe I can help improve
            productivity and concentration by using reaction time. (Thinkabout, 2020) </p>
        <p>My system works by user pressing a button on the website to start the game. The lights on the microbit will
            then light up before turning off at the same time, after a random time. The user will press the button again
            quickly after the lights turn off to log reaction time and the area temperature. This data will be compared
            to externally sourced data to predict/inform decisions on Sport and Productivity. My target audience is
            people looking to pick up sports, along with people who long manual labour jobs. </p>
        <p>My research enabled me to identify the key factors to implement and abstract by looking the features of each
            system I investigated and comparing to the project brief. I will abstract the CSS styling, creating an
            account function, other games on my final system along with the “Contact us" and "Privacy Policy” pages.
        </p>
        <p>My objectives are to model a system which:
        <ul class="textlist">
            <li>Is fully automated, uses the analogue temperature input, the reaction time input, the analogue audio
                output and the digital LED output </li>
            <li>Validates and stores the data gathered from the microbit in firebase </li>
            <li>Analyses the data gathered to inform decisions on what sport the user should take up. Data will also be
                analysed to inform the decision on whether a manual worker needs a break to increase productivity. </li>
            <li>Uses Python and/or JavaScript to create a graph of reaction times which effects the what if questions.
            </li>
            <li>Offers wellbeing insights based on these two “what if” questions: </li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;What if the user was to take up a sport? Parameters: Age,Gender,Reaction time </li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;What if the user was to take a break from their manual labour? Parameters: Reaction time,
                Time Working , Temperature </li>
            <li>Graphs the history of the user's reaction time </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Plan and design</h2>
        <p>Users start the system by clicking a button on the website. The microbit's lights turn on one by one. They
            then go off together after a random time. Users then quickly press the button again after the lights go off
            to record their reaction time and the current temperature of the area. After analyzing this data, along with
            externally sourced data, the two “what if” questions will be answered, and the information will be displayed
            to user on the website </p>
        <p>This system meets the requirements of the brief as it Is automated has an analogue temperature input, digital
            reaction time input, analogue audio output and digital LED output. The system also validates and stores this
            input
            data in firebase </p>
        <p>The system will analyse the input data to make decisions on what sport the user should take up. This will
            also inform a decision on if a manual worker should take a break to increase their productivity. </p>
        <p>Agile was used when making this project. The system uses a decision-making model to determine the answers to
            what what-if questions. </p>
        <p>The system will use Python and JavaScript to make a graph of the user's reaction times which will be a data
            input for the “what if” questions. </p>
        <p>These “what if” questions will be: “What if the user was to take up a sport?” with the parameters of Age,
            Gender and Reaction time. The second what if question will be: “What if the user was to take a break from
            their manual labour?” with the parameters of Reaction time, Age and Temperature </p>

        <br><a href="graphflow.html">mockgraph.html Flowchart</a>
        <p>For the technologies I will use, I will use the microbit. The microbit is a hardware ARM-based embedded
            system. It will be used in showing the 5 lights for the reaction time game ,audio output and temperature
            input. </p>
        <p>Other technologies I will use include:</p>
        <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It will be used in coding up data transfer to
            and from firebase. </p>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language and the core technology of the World Wide Web. I will use it in coding
            related to the website and data transfer </p>
        <p>HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It will be used
            to code by the website </p>
        <p>Visual studio code is an IDE. It will be used for coding HTML , CSS and JavaScript. </p>
        <p>Thonny is an IDE. It will be used for coding python. </p>
        <p>Google Firebase is a backend cloud computing service and application development platform. It will be used to
            store the input data and other data required for the project. </p>

            <li>Wrote code to Initialize the firebase database with the JavaScript of my website </li>
            <li>Overcame the problem of the getDatabase() function not working by realizing I need to import the
                function from firebase itself, along with other functions. </li>
            <li>Tested adding, updating, removing and retrieving data from firebase using JavaScript to enhance my
                knowledge of using firebase with JavaScript, as i previously only knew how to do this using python and

                specifically inputted values. I did this by using the for Each function to find the keys of all the
                firebase data values and adding them to an array, before finding the largest of these values </li>

                a new method of doing this to overcome the problem </li>

            <li>Overcame the problem that the reaction time was in milliseconds, and i will need it in seconds for
                calculations for finding how the users reaction time compares to the average for their age and gender. I
                did this by creating a string of “0.” and i added the strings of the 0. and the user's reaction time
                before converting it into a number for calculations </li>
            <li>Tested the variables to ensure the Reaction time, Age, Gender, Time elapsed working and temperature of

                whatif question of the area around them. Also wrote code to display this on the website </li>
            <li>Overcame the problem of the reaction time being incorrectly used in calculations. No matter what the
                time in miliseconds was “0.” was being added to the reaction time to convert to seconds. Fixed this so
                it was properly converted </li>
