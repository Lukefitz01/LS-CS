    <h2>Universal Design</h2>
    <p> My website includes Equitable use by making the design appealing to all users by the button and navbar styling
    </p>
    <p> My website includes Flexibility in use by haveing padding on the input fields and centering the form to
        accoomdate for left and right handed use</p>
    <p>My website includes Simple and Intuitive Use by providing effective prompting and feedback during and after task
        completion, most notably when input fields and missing an alert pops up with what field is not filled in</p>
    <p>My website includes Perceptible Information as all information is legible and not obstructed by a background
        colour that would have made the text unreadable or hard to read</p>
    <p>My Website includes Tolerance for Error by providing warnings of hazards and errors, along with providing
        fail-safe features. If a user forgets to input a field , an alert pops up telling them what field they have
        forgotten . If a credit card num is entered incorrectly , the website checks that also and implements an alert
        to tell the user </p>
    <p>My website includes Low physical effort by minimising sustained phyisical effort by reducing the length of the
        form by putting some input fields beside each other and bot every input field in a straight line </p>
    <p>My website includes Size and Space for Approach and Use by making all components comfortable for any seated of
        standing user. This is implemented by padding on the input fields to make them easier to click along with a big
        submit button </p>
