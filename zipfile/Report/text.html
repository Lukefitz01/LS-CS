        <h2 id="mb">Meeting The Brief</h2>
        <h2 id="in">Investigation</h2>
        <p>The first system I investigated was Fitbit. One feature of Fitbit is tracking step count by using an
            accelerometer and transferring the analogue movement data to digital data. I liked the way the Fitbit
            transfers this data from analogue to digital and investigated using a step-counting system in my project,
            but I rejected it as I found the plausibility of having to carry around the microbit limited. (McLaughlin,
            2021) </p>
        <p>The second system I investigated was the walk in my shoes website. The website uses mindfulness exercise and
            wellness activities to help people relax. I liked the proven effectiveness of mindfulness exercises in use
            here, but rejected this system due to the difficulty of making auditory recordings for my project (Wellbeing
            activities for Young People) </p>
        <p>The final system I investigated is Reaction Time & Reflex Test app. The apps main feature is a game that
            tracks your reaction time and logs your progression. I chose this system as I believe I can help improve
            productivity and concentration by using reaction time. (Thinkabout, 2020) </p>
        <p>My system works by user pressing a button on the website to start the game. The lights on the microbit will
            then light up before turning off at the same time, after a random time. The user will press the button again
            quickly after the lights turn off to log reaction time and the area temperature. This data will be compared
            to externally sourced data to predict/inform decisions on Sport and Productivity. My target audience is
            people looking to pick up sports, along with people who long manual labour jobs, and those who spend a lot of time working on computers </p>
        <p>My research enabled me to identify the key factors to implement and abstract by looking the features of each
            system I investigated and comparing to the project brief. I will abstract the CSS styling, creating an
            account function, other games on my final system along with the “Contact us" and "Privacy Policy” pages.
        </p>
        <p>My objectives are to model a system which:
        <ul class="textlist">
            <li>Is fully automated, uses the analogue temperature input, the reaction time input, the analogue audio
                output and the digital LED output </li>
            <li>Validates and stores the data gathered from the microbit in firebase </li>
            <li>Analyses the data gathered to inform decisions on what sport the user should take up. Data will also be
                analysed to inform the decision on whether a manual worker needs a break to increase productivity. </li>
            <li>Uses Python and/or JavaScript to create a graph of reaction times which effects the what if questions.
            </li>
            <li>Offers wellbeing insights based on these two “what if” questions: </li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;What if the user was to take up a sport? Parameters: Age,Gender,Reaction time </li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;What if the user was to take a break from their manual labour? Parameters: Reaction time,
                Time Working , Temperature </li>
            <li>Graphs the history of the user's reaction time </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on how my project works, it will meet the Basic and Advanced requirements in the brief</p>

        <h2 id="pd">Plan and design</h2>
        <p>Users start the system by clicking a button on the website. The microbit's lights turn on one by one. They
            then go off together after a random time. Users then quickly press the button again after the lights go off
            to record their reaction time and the current temperature of the area. After analyzing this data, along with
            externally sourced data, the two “what if” questions will be answered, and the information will be displayed
            to user on the website </p>
        <p>This system meets the requirements of the brief as it Is automated has an analogue temperature input, digital
            reaction time input, analogue audio output and digital LED output. The system also validates and stores this
            input
            data in firebase </p>
        <p>The system will analyse the input data to make decisions on what sport the user should take up. This will
            also inform a decision on if a manual worker should take a break to increase their productivity. </p>
        <p>Agile was used when making this project.While the over all target was to create the reaction time system  and fulfull the basic and advanced requirments, this was broken down into smaller tasks as detailed in the create log with each stage being tested as it was developed. </p>
        <p>The system uses a decision-making model to determine the answers to
            what what-if questions. </p>
            
        <p>The system will use Python and JavaScript to make a graph of the user's reaction times which will be a data
            input for the “what if” questions. </p>
        <p>These “what if” questions will be: “What if the user was to take up a sport?” with the parameters of Age,
            Gender and Reaction time. The second what if question will be: “What if the user was to take a break from
            their manual labour?” with the parameters of Reaction time, Age and Temperature </p>

        <br><a href="graphflow.html">mockgraph.html Flowchart</a>
        <p>For the technologies I will use, I will use the microbit. The microbit is a hardware ARM-based embedded
            system. It will be used in showing the 5 lights for the reaction time game ,audio output and temperature
            input. </p>
        <p>Other technologies I will use include:</p>
        <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It will be used in coding up data transfer to
            and from firebase. </p>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language and the core technology of the World Wide Web. I will use it in coding
            related to the website and data transfer </p>
        <p>HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It will be used
            to code by the website </p>
        <p>Visual studio code is an IDE. It will be used for coding HTML , CSS and JavaScript. </p>
        <p>Thonny is an IDE. It will be used for coding python. </p>
        <p>Google Firebase is a backend cloud computing service and application development platform. It will be used to
            store the input data and other data required for the project. </p>
        <p>My project follows the principles of universal design by using alt text for images, having a simple and easy to understand design , having a tolerance for error and low physical effort through having big buttons, and having in-page links for Size and Space for Approach and Use </p>

            <li>Wrote code to Initialize the firebase database with the JavaScript of my website </li>
            <li>Overcame the problem of the getDatabase() function not working by realizing I need to import the
                function from firebase itself, along with other functions. </li>
            <li>Tested adding, updating, removing and retrieving data from firebase using JavaScript to enhance my
                knowledge of using firebase with JavaScript, as i previously only knew how to do this using python and

            <li>I overcame the problem of not being able to find the latest reaction time value, only being able to find
                specifically inputted values. I did this by using the for Each function to find the keys of all the
                firebase data values and adding them to an array, before finding the largest of these values </li>
            <li>Tested pressing the button on the website to ensure it gave the latest reaction time value </li>

            <li>Overcame the problem that the reaction time was in milliseconds, and i will need it in seconds for
                calculations for finding how the users reaction time compares to the average for their age and gender. I
                did this by creating a string of “0.” and i added the strings of the 0. and the user's reaction time
                before converting it into a number for calculations </li>
            <li>Tested the variables to ensure the Reaction time, Age, Gender, Time elapsed working and temperature of

            <li>Overcame the problem of the reaction time being incorrectly used in calculations. No matter what the
                time in miliseconds was “0.” was being added to the reaction time to convert to seconds. Fixed this so
                it was properly converted </li>

        <p>I believe the final artefact met all the requirements of the brief successfully.</p>
        <p>My projects Basic Requirements went quite well while making my project. I managed to create both digital and analogue inputs and outputs related to wellbeing for my project and send the inputted data to firebase to be stored. I used this inputted data in multiple analysis components. The only real setback during the completion of the basic requirements was that it took time to find a suitable digital output. The artefact meets the basic requirements well. </p>
        <p>The Advanced requirements also went well. The artefact meets all 3 advanced requirements well. I managed to source an external dataset of reaction times and along with the user's inputted data, a computer model was successfully created to find answers to the what if questions based on three parameters. A graph was only created of the history of the user's reaction times.  </p>
        <p>While the artefact met all 3 advanced requirements successfully, I believe the code I wrote to do so was quite long, and with more learning could have been more condensed, making it easier to read through and making a simpler flowchart. Having to find multiple variations of reaction time for many age groups caused this. I believe if I were to do the project again, I could do all this in a function using a for/while loop instead of using many if statements. </p>
        <p>My project has met the needs of the end user. My survey showed that the end user wishes to increase their fitness and concentration. The user also believes that taking up a new sport and increasing their productivity would positively impact their wellbeing </p>
        <p>My project will suggest a set of new sports for the user to take up depending on age, gender and reaction time. This will help the user increase their fitness. My project will suggest whether the user should take a break from their labour. If taking a break will improve productivity, the system will suggest that, improving the user's productivity. Improving productivity will improve the user's concentration. </p>
        <p>I believe that my project could be improved by adding a new system of recording reaction time, along with keeping my original system. Using multiple ways of recording the user's reaction time would increase accuracy in recording the user's reaction time, as they could be good or bad at specific “games”/ways of recording reaction time. </p>
